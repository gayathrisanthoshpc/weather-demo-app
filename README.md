# 🌤 Weather Smart Demo App

This is a simple and interactive Weather Demo App I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a mini frontend project. It shows weather details based on user input and is designed to look and behave like a real weather app — but runs fully in demo mode without needing any API key.

The goal of this project was to practice UI design, JavaScript logic, and handling user input in a clean and user-friendly way.


## ✨ What this app can do

- Lets users search any city name  
- Shows weather in a clean card layout  
- Supports Enter key for quick search  
- Always gives a result for demo purposes  
- Smooth UI with simple animations  
- Works offline — no external API needed  


## 🛠 Built With

No frameworks — only core web technologies.


## ▶ How to run it

1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the project folder

## 🎯 Project Purpose
